        The Humanitarian Catastrophe of the War in Yemen and the Conflicting
        Interests at Stake
      </h2>
      <p>
        Since the 2011 Houthi insurgence, the State of Yemen is trapped in a
        spiral of violence that ultimately escalated into a bloody civil war,
        which is of global concern since it also acquired a geopolitical
        dimension, first and foremost with the intervention of Saudi Arabia and
        UAE in 2015. The history of Yemen is a complicated one, due both to
        internal factors (rebellions, civil wars, the differences between
        northern and southern Yemen) and to the relationship with bordering
        Saudi Arabia and other foreign countries which intervened during the
        civil wars. Overall, the Saudi policy towards Yemen aimed at the
        containment of the Yemeni government to avoid challenges to Saudi
        security; at the same time, to avoid the economic collapse of the
        country, which would destabilise the entire region, financial aid was
        provided by Saudi Arabia. In 2011, pro-democracy protesters started
        demonstrations in order to force former President Ali Abdullah Saleh to
        end his thirty-year-rule. He did not resign, and so demonstrations
        continued until March 2011, when tensions in Sana’a, the capital city,
        ended up in shootings on the protesters by the military. The President
        was forced to transfer his powers to his Vice-President, Hadi, after
        negotiation by the Gulf Cooperation Council.

      <h2>Respublic of Syria Year:2011</h2>
      <p>
        The Syrian civil war, which has devastated the entire country of Syria
        and its neighbors, is a complex conflict that involves several nations,
        rebel groups and terrorist organizations. What started as a nonviolent
        protest in 2011 quickly escalated into full-blown warfare. Since the
        fighting began, more than 470,000 people have been killed, with over 1
        million injured and millions more forced to flee their homes and live as
        refugees. In early 2011, a series of political and economic protests in
        Egypt and Tunisia broke out. These successful revolts, dubbed the Arab
        Spring, served as an inspiration for pro-democracy activists in Syria.

      <h2>Conflict in Ukraine Year:2022</h2>
      <p>
        Recent Developments For CFR's full coverage of Ukraine, please visit our
        topic page. Since Russia launched a full-scale military invasion into
        Ukraine on February 24, 2022, fighting has caused over nine hundred
        civilian deaths and pushed millions of Ukrainians to flee to neighboring
        countries—the majority of whom have arrived in Poland, a NATO country
        where U.S. troops are preparing to offer assistance to refugees.
